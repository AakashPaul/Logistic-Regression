# Logistic-Regression
In this repository, we will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

Suppose that we are the administrator of a university department and we want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. we have historical data from previous applicants that we can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. Our task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.

This project has been done as a part of Andrew Ng's machine learning course in coursera . Although the course supports the use of octave/Matlab the given project is written in python language because of its popularity in the industry.This is a very basic level program as i am just starting out with machine learning and getting to learn new algorithms.
